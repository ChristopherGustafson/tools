# Software Development Tools ðŸ§°

At some point in my early software development career, I realised that tools play an integral part in the development process. They are important, but there are also a very large ocean of them out there. In an effort to make more sense of all the tools out there, I made this repo to keep track of the tools I use, and store some of the useful configurations and scripts I have used in the past. Feel free to use any of these if you find it useful.

## Table of Contents

I will add an table of contents for the whole repo here at some point.

## VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my editor of choice.

## Version Control

## Debugging

## Terminal

This is a collection of the tools and configurations I use for my terminal.
